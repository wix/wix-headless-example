# Wix Headless Examples

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project provides a minimal example site to demonstrate basic usage of various Wix
Headless APIs. The implementation focuses on simplicity and readability, rather than feature richness, performance, or
completeness. This repository can be used as a quick reference for bootstrapping a Wix Headless application.

For a more comprehensive example of Wix Headless integration, we recommend checking out
our [starter templates](https://www.wix.com/developers/headless/templates).

You can view the latest version of this repo deployed
at [https://wix-headless-example.vercel.app/](https://wix-headless-example.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

There are two ways to experiment with the example site functionality:

### Code Sandbox

1. Fork the CodeSandbox project by click **Fork** in the top right corner.
2. In [constants/constants.js](./constants/constants.js), replace the existing client ID with your own. You can find
   your client
   ID
   under [headless settings](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Select%20Site&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https:%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fdashboard%2F%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D%2Foauth-apps-settings)
   in your project dashboard.
3. **Make sure you save any changes in order to see their effect**

### Copy the project to your local workspace

1. Clone the [github repo](https://github.com/wix/wix-headless-example/tree/main).
2. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd wix-headless-example
    npm install
    ```

3. In [constants/constants.js](./constants/constants.js), replace the existing client ID with your own. You can find
   your client
   ID
   under [headless settings](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Select%20Site&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https:%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fdashboard%2F%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D%2Foauth-apps-settings)
   in your project dashboard.
4. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
